##  AWS Service Rundown

<details>
<summary> Compute</summary>

Compute in AWS refers to the processing power required to run applications and workloads.  
Examples include:
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Virtual servers for running applications.  
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.  

**Why it matters:** Compute resources allow applications to scale, handle workloads efficiently, and reduce infrastructure management overhead.

<details>
<summary> Networking</summary>

Networking in AWS connects resources securely and efficiently.  
Examples include:
- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Isolated networks for organizing and securing resources.  
- **Amazon Route 53:** DNS service for routing traffic globally.  

**Why it matters:** Networking ensures resources communicate reliably, securely, and at scale across regions and environments.

<details>
<summary> Storage</summary>

Storage in AWS provides scalable and durable options for data.  
Examples include:
- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Object storage for files, backups, and static websites.  
- **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Block storage for EC2 instances.  

**Why it matters:** Storage solutions ensure data is accessible, secure, and cost-optimized for different workloads.

<details>
<summary> Databases</summary>

Databases organize and manage structured or unstructured data.  
Examples include:
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.  
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** NoSQL database for high-performance applications.  

**Why it matters:** Databases provide reliable data storage, querying, and scalability for applications of all sizes.
</details>

<details>
<summary> Security</summary>

Security in AWS ensures resources are protected and access is controlled.  
Examples include:
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Roles, policies, and permissions for users and services.  
- **Encryption:** Protects data at rest and in transit.  

**Why it matters:** Security is foundational to cloud computing, ensuring compliance, privacy, and trust in applications.
